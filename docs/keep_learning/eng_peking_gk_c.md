## Intro. 引入
<p class='ins'>2021北京英语高考题阅读理解C篇是我做题这么久以来第一次就算大致看懂了文章讲什么也不会做题的阅读。老师讲的时候估计也不知道怎么让我们明白，最后让我们“自己感受”。</p>
<p class='ins'>我真不相信京爷高考题这么糙，于是昨天晚上(2026/3/5)我花了一整个晚二(100min)（原本以为只要半个的），几乎彻底地搞懂了这道难度极高却又十分巧妙的阅读。同时我也发现了一些小问题——不影响它的质量。</p>

<p class='ins'>Hundreds of scientists, writers and academics sounded a warning to humanity in an open letter published last December: Policymakers and the rest of us must engage openly with the risk of global collapse. Researchers in many areas have projected the widespread collapse as “a credible scenario (情景) this century”.
</p>

<p class='ins'>A survey of scientists found that extreme weather events, food insecurity, and freshwater shortages might create global collapse. Of course, if you are a non-human species, collapse is well underway. 
</p>

<p class='ins'>The call for public engagement with the unthinkable is especially germane in this moment of still-uncontrolled pandemic and economic crises in the world’s most technologically advanced nations. Not very long ago, it was also unthinkable that a virus would shut down nations and that safety nets would be proven so disastrously lacking in flexibility.</p>

<p class='ins'>The international scholars’ warning letter doesn’t say exactly what collapse will look like or when it might happen. Collapseology, the study of collapse, is more concerned with identifying trends and with them the dangers of everyday civilization. Among the signatories (签署者) of the warning was Bob Johnson, the originator of the “ecological footprint” concept, which measures the total amount of environmental input needed to maintain a given lifestyle. With the current footprint of humanity, “it seems that global collapse is certain to happen in some form, possibly within a decade, certainly within this century,” Johnson said in an email.
</p>

<p class='ins'>Only if we discuss the consequences of our biophysical limits, the December warning letter says, can we have the hope to reduce their “speed, severity and harm”. And yet messengers of the coming disturbance are likely to be ignored. We all want to hope things will turn out fine. As a poet wrote,
</p>
<p align='center'>Man is a victim of dope (麻醉品)</p>
<p align='center'>In the incurable form of hope.</p>
<p class='ins'>The hundreds of scholars who signed the letter are intent (执着) on quieting hope that ignores preparedness. “Let’s look directly into the issue of collapse,” they say, “and deal with the terrible possibilities of what we see there to make the best of a troubling future.”
</p>
<p>
28. What does the underlined word “germane” in Paragraph 3 probably mean?<br/>-
A. Scientific.      B. Credible.      C. Original.       D. Relevant.

29. As for the public awareness of global collapse, the author is ______.<br/>
A. worried         B. puzzled         C. surprised     D. scared

内容均是我的自译，不一定完全正确<br>

### Paragraph 1
<p class='ins ps'>Hundreds of scientists, writers and academics sounded a warning to humanity in an open letter published last December: Policymakers and the rest of us must engage openly with the risk of global collapse. Researchers in many areas have projected the widespread collapse as “a <span class='hl'>credible</span> scenario (情景) this century”.
</p>
<p class='ins'>学者、作家、科学家于12月公开信发出警告：政策制定者于与剩下的人必须公开地合作以对抗全球崩溃这一风险。多地地研究人员认为（推测）广泛的崩溃为“本世纪有证据的可信情景”。</p>
<p class='ins hl'>这里类似导言。注意这里的credible指的是推测的未来——会发生崩溃，而非他们的公开信credible。</p>

### Paragraph 2
<p class='ins ps'>A survey of scientists found that extreme weather events, food insecurity, and freshwater shortages might create global collapse. <span class='hl'>Of course, if you are a non-human species, collapse is well underway. </span>
</p>
<p class='ins'>极端条件导致全球崩溃。如果你并非人类，崩溃早已开始。</p>
<p class='ins hl'>这段分析了崩溃的原因。你可能以为"Of course, if you are a non-human species, collapse is well underway"是个笑话从而认为作者“风格飘逸”，但事实并非如此。<span style='color:red;'>这里是我认为北京高考题出的不是很好的地方——引发了完全偏离文章的歧义，这个后面再讲。</span></p>

### Paragraph 3
<p class='ins ps'>The call for public engagement with the <span class='hl'>unthinkable</span> is especially germane in this moment of still-uncontrolled pandemic and economic crises in the world’s most technologically advanced nations. Not very long ago, <span class='hl' >it was also unthinkable that </span> a virus would shut down nations and that safety nets would be proven so disastrously lacking in flexibility.</p>
<p class='ins'>呼吁公众参与的倡议在当今疫情尚未停息、经济仍然危机的时代尤为相关，尤其在那些科技最发达的国家。不久以前，<span style='color:red;' >谁也没想到</span>一个病毒会让国家停摆以及证明安全网络如此缺乏适应能力。</p>
<p class='ins hl'>注意这里的unthinkable，这并非surprised，更像是对现状的陈述，就像一个人说“谁有想得到那年竟然XXX呢？”也许那年他惊讶，但现在就像是在回忆在进行叙述。而这“unthinkable”恰恰说明了大众对于"collapse"的无知，因此我们能从这里间接地看出public awareness(大众意识)的缺乏。</p>

### Paragraph 4
<p class='ins ps'>The international scholars’ warning letter doesn’t say exactly what collapse will look like or when it might happen. Collapseology, the study of collapse, is more concerned with identifying trends and with them the dangers of everyday civilization. Among the signatories (签署者) of the warning was Bob Johnson, the originator of the “ecological footprint” concept, which measures the total amount of environmental input needed to maintain a given lifestyle. With the current footprint of humanity, “it seems that global collapse is certain to happen in some form, possibly within a decade, certainly within this century,” Johnson said in an email.
</p>
<p class='ins'>介绍崩溃学，引出发明生态足迹的科学家WilliamRees(高考选文改成了BobJhonson但是现实里甚至没有叫这个名字且出名的人)。用名言论证现在人类的生态足迹会让崩溃发生于本世纪，也许十年内发生。</p>

</p>

<p class='ins'>Hundreds of scientists, writers and academics from 30 countries sounded a warning to humanity in an open letter published in the Guardian in December: Policymakers and the rest of us must “engage openly with the risk of disruption and even collapse of our societies.” “Damage to the climate and environment” will be the overarching cause, and “researchers in many areas” have projected widespread social collapse as “a credible scenario this century.”
</p><p class='ins'>It’s not hard to find the “collapseology” studies they are talking about. In a report for the sustainability group Future Earth, a survey of scientists found that extreme weather events, food insecurity, freshwater shortages and the broad degradation of life-sustaining ecosystems “have the potential to impact and amplify one another in ways that might cascade to create global systemic collapse.” A 2019 report from the Breakthrough National Center for Climate Restoration, a think tank in Australia, projected that a rapidly warming world of depleted resources and mounting pollution would lead to “a largely uninhabitable Earth” and a “breakdown of nations and the international order.” Analysts in the U.S. and British military over the past two years have issued similar warnings of climate- and environment-driven chaos.
</p><p class='ins'>
Of course, if you are a nonhuman species, collapse is well underway. Ninety-nine percent of the tall grass prairie in North America is gone, by one estimate; 96% of the biomass of mammals — biomass is their weight on Earth — now consists of humans, our pets and our farm animals; nearly 90% of the fish stocks the U.N. monitors are either fully exploited, over exploited or depleted; a multiyear study in Germany showed a 76% decline in insect biomass.
</p><p class='ins'>The call for public engagement with the unthinkable is especially germane in this moment of still-uncontrolled pandemic, institutional failures and economic crises in the world’s most technologically advanced nations. Not very long ago, it was also unthinkable that a virus would shut down nations and that safety nets would be proven so disastrously lacking in resilience.
</p><p class='ins'>
The international scholars’ warning doesn’t venture to say exactly what collapse will look like or when it might happen. Collapseology is more concerned with identifying trends and with them the dangers of everyday civilization: ever-expanding economic growth, rapacious consumption of resources and the saturation of the planet’s limited repositories for waste.
</p><p class='ins'>
Among the signatories of the warning was William Rees, a population ecologist at the University of British Columbia best known as the originator of the “ecological footprint” concept, which measures the total amount of environmental input needed to maintain a given lifestyle. With the current footprint of humanity — most egregiously the footprint of the energy- and resource-entitled Global North — “it seems that some form of global societal collapse is inevitable, possibly within a decade, certainly within this century,” Rees said in an email.
</p><p class='ins'>
The most pressing proximate cause of biophysical collapse is what he calls overshoot: humans exploiting natural systems faster than the systems can regenerate. The human enterprise is financing its growth and development by liquidating biophysical “capital” essential to its own existence. We are dumping waste at rates beyond nature’s assimilative capacity. Warming temperatures, plunging biodiversity, worldwide deforestation and ocean pollution, among other problems, are all important in their own right. But each is a mere symptom of overshoot, says Rees.
</p><p class='ins'>
The message we should glean from the evidence is that all human enterprise is ultimately determined by biophysical limits. We are exceptional animals, but we are not exempt from the laws of nature.
</p><p class='ins'>
Another of the signatories on the warning letter is Will Steffen, a retired Earth systems scientist from Australian National University. Steffen singles out the neoliberal economic growth paradigm — the pursuit of ever expanding GDP — as “incompatible with a well-functioning Earth system at the planetary level.” Collapse, he told an interviewer, “is the most likely outcome of the present trajectory of the current system, as prophetically modelled in ‘Limits to Growth. ‘ “
</p><p class='ins'>
“Limits to Growth” is a 150-page bombshell of a book published in 1972. The authors, a team of MIT scientists, created a computerized system-dynamics model called World3, the first of its kind, to examine worldwide growth trends from 1900 to 1970. They extrapolated from the historical data to model 12 future scenarios projected to the year 2100.
</p><p class='ins'>
The models showed that any system based on exponential economic and population growth crashed eventually. The gloomiest model was the one in which the “present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged.” In that “business as usual” scenario, collapse would begin slowly in the 2020s and accelerate thereafter. Updates to the “Limits” study have found that its projections, so far, have been spot-on.
</p><p class='ins'>
Only if we discuss the consequences of our biophysical limits, the December warning letter says, can we reduce their “likelihood, speed, severity and harm.” And yet messengers of the coming turmoil are likely to be ignored — crowned doomers, collapseniks, marginal and therefore discountable. We all want to hope things will turn out fine. “Man is a victim of dope/In the incurable form of hope,” as poet Ogden Nash wrote.
</p><p class='ins'>
The hundreds of scholars who signed the letter are intent on quieting hope that ignores preparedness. Let’s look directly into the abyss of collapse, they say, and deal with the terrible possibilities of what we see there “to make the best of a turbulent future.”
